                    <p>I believe in God,<br />
                        the Father almighty,<br />
                        creator of heaven and earth.</p>

                    <p>I believe in Jesus Christ,<br />
                        God's only Son, our Lord,<br />
                        who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br />
                        born of the Virgin Mary,<br />
                        suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br />
                        was crucified, died, and was buried;<br />
                        he descended to the dead.<br />
                        On the third day he rose again;<br />
                        he ascended into heaven,<br />
                        he is seated at the right hand of the Father,<br />
                        and he will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>

                    <p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                        the holy catholic church,
                        the communion of saints,
                        the forgiveness of sins,
                        the resurrection of the body,
                        and the life everlasting.</p>

                    <p>Amen.</p>
